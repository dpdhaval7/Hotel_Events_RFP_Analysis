Hotel Data Case Study: Power BI Report
Introduction â€“ What is Eventbright?
Eventbright is a global platform that allows individuals and organizations to plan, promote, and manage events. Through Eventbright, event planners can send Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to hotels and venues to host events such as conferences, meetings, or social gatherings. These RFPs include key event details (e.g., room nights, attendees, event dates), and hotels respond with proposals, quotes, and availability. This interaction is crucial for hotel sales teams to convert leads into bookings.

Dataset containing RFP submissions to a hotel is provided to you. Your task is to analyze the hotel's performance and derive actionable insights.
